# Cortana-Photography
A basic HTML and CSS with a sprinkle of JS page
It depicts Nature's photography.
All images are from Unsplash.
Working on making it multiple pages.
I'm still quite a novice at this.


I have  eventually added about 5 more pages, but with the same css design.
This is just practice tho.

I need more hands on learning.
